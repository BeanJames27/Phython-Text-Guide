# Phython-Text-Guide
You will learn how to use variables and how to print lines of text/shapes
To start lets start out with a basic Shape printing.
print("   /|")
print("  / |")
print(" /  |")
print("/___|")

This code will make it so when you run it that it will print out a triangle. Pretty Epic I know. But the same goes for anything. You can do something like

Print("Red mad sus") 

And it will print it out. (Also sorry for the cringe of the red sus lol)
Now lets try something diffrent. Lets make a story

character_name = ("Jake The Dog")
character_age = 38
print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ",")
print("He was " + character_age + " ")
print("He really like the name " + character_name + ",")
print("But he did not like being "+ character_age + ".")

So here, basicly this code is including Variables. The Variabels are "charcter_name" and "charcter_age". Essintelly what thesse varibals are doing is making it easier to change sertian text. Take this for an example lets say we wanted to change the charcter to finn from adventure time we would go to the variable "charcter_name = ("Jake the Dog") And change it to "character_name = ("Finn") Same goes for age you can change that to "character_age = 17 

These are some basics. This is my first turtorail please do not be mad if there is any errors. Thank you.
